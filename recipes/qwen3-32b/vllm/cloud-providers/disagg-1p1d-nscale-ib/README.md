# Qwen3-32B 1P1D Cross-Node Disagg — Nscale NDR-IB Variant (B200)

This is the **Nscale managed K8s** member of the cross-provider benchmark family. For the family-wide topology, perf-measurement protocol, and result format, see [`../README.md`](../README.md).

> **Deploy:** this variant is a kustomize overlay. After creating the model cache, run `kubectl apply -k .` from this directory (kustomize stitches in [`../_base`](../_base/)); see the [family Deploy section](../README.md#deploy).

This README only documents the Nscale-specific overrides + measured results.

## What this variant overrides

| Override | Value |
|---|---|
| **RDMA resource** | `rdma/ib: "1"` per pod (Network Operator shared-device plugin slot; grants all 8 HCAs via `/dev/infiniband/*`) |
| **NIXL backend selection** | Defaults — UCX backend (no `DYN_KVBM_NIXL_BACKEND_*` env overrides) |
| **Transport env** | `UCX_NET_DEVICES=mlx5_0:1,mlx5_1:1,mlx5_2:1,mlx5_3:1,mlx5_4:1,mlx5_5:1,mlx5_10:1,mlx5_11:1` (the 8 compute-fabric NICs only). **Explicit list is load-bearing on Nscale**  The side fabric `mlx5_6..9` (MTU 512, different IB subnet) must also be excluded — mixing fabrics causes `NIXL_ERR_REMOTE_DISCONNECT` at first transfer (observed historically with `mlx5_0..7` list). **No `UCX_TLS`** — let UCX auto-probe transports (allowlists break wireup AM selection). |
| **Host volume mount** | `/dev/infiniband` (hostPath) + `/dev/shm` (emptyDir, 64Gi) |


## Nscale-specific findings

- **`rdma/ib: "1"` is a slot count, not an HCA count.** Requesting `rdma/ib: "8"` will leave pods Pending (no node will satisfy it under the shared-device plugin model). One slot grants access to all 8 NDR HCAs via `/dev/infiniband/`.
- **`privileged: true` + `IPC_LOCK`** are still required for NIXL VRAM memory registration via UCX `ucp_mem_map` on B200.
- **`UCX_NET_DEVICES` must list the compute-fabric NICs explicitly** — otherwise workers won't start.
