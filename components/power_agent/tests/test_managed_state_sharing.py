"""Regression tests for the single-copy managed-state invariant.

In production the daemon entrypoint runs ``power_agent.py`` as the
top-level ``__main__`` module, while ``actuator.py`` reaches it via
``import power_agent`` — two distinct module objects in ``sys.modules``.
If the managed-GPU sets lived in ``power_agent.py`` they would fork into
two independent copies: the actuator would record freshly-capped GPUs into
one while the SIGTERM handler restored from the other (always empty), so
every cap would silently leak past graceful shutdown.

The fix hosts that state in ``managed_state`` (imported by canonical name
from both sites) and aliases ``power_agent._managed_gpu_indices`` /
``power_agent._previously_managed`` to it. These tests lock in the
invariants that make the fix work:

  1. the ``power_agent`` names ARE the ``managed_state`` objects (identity);
  2. a cap recorded straight into ``managed_state`` (as the actuator's
     separate module copy would) is visible to the SIGTERM restore loop; and
  3. startup orphan-recovery reloads state IN PLACE — it must never rebind
     the alias, which would re-introduce the dual-copy bug.
