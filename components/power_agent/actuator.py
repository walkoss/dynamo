"""Actuator abstraction for the Power Agent.

Defines the `Actuator` Protocol and two implementations:

  - `NvmlActuator` — the path that shipped in PR #9682. Used on
    clusters where the GPU Operator's `dcgm.enabled=false` (default).
    Delegates to the existing module-level NVML helpers in
    `power_agent.py` so the 43 PR A tests pass unchanged.
  - `DcgmActuator` — used on clusters where the GPU Operator's
    `dcgm.enabled=true`. Connects standalone-TCP to the
    `nvidia-dcgm` hostengine and routes per-GPU `dcgmConfigSet`
    + optional `dcgmConfigEnforce` writes through it. PID
    enumeration intentionally stays on NVML because DCGM does not
    expose a snapshot-of-running-PIDs API
    (`DCGM_FI_DEV_COMPUTE_PIDS` is a time-series field; see §6.3
    note 2 of the design doc).

The two are mutually exclusive at chart-install time — a Power
Agent process binds to exactly one actuator at startup and holds
it for its lifetime. See `docs/design-docs/power-agent-dual-actuator.md`
§6.4 for the selection mechanic and §6.6 for the
mutual-exclusion-by-construction guarantees.

Lazy imports
------------
Every method that touches `pynvml`, `pydcgm`, `dcgm_structs`,
`dcgm_agent`, or `dcgm_fields` imports it inside the method body
rather than at module top. Three reasons:

  1. The NVML-only deployment (the chart default) must not pay the
     `libdcgm.so` dlopen cost (~3 s on slow base images).
  2. Tests patch `power_agent.pynvml`; the `NvmlActuator` methods
     access pynvml via that re-exported reference so the patches
     stay effective without test changes.
  3. Avoids a circular import (`power_agent` imports `actuator`,
     `NvmlActuator` calls into `power_agent`).

            corrected here.

    Used on clusters where the GPU Operator's `dcgm.enabled=true`.
    Connects standalone-TCP to the operator-managed `nvidia-dcgm`
    hostengine, calls `dcgmConfigSet(mPowerLimit.val=W)` for the cap
    write, and optionally calls `dcgmConfigEnforce` to register the
    cap as DCGM's "target configuration" so it is automatically
    re-applied after a GPU reset or reinit
    (`DcgmConfigManager.h:113-117`, `dcgm_test_apis.h:180-183`).
    That reset/reinit auto-reapply is the single resilience property
    DCGM genuinely buys over NVML — there is **no** tick-driven
    re-enforce loop in DCGM source, and `dcgmConfigEnforce` does
    **not** make the cap survive Power Agent restart (the agent's
    SIGTERM handler restores default regardless). See the design
    doc's v1.5 changelog and §7 for the corrected accounting.

    Asymmetric reads (intentional)
    ------------------------------
    `list_running_pids` calls `pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetComputeRunningProcesses`
    even on the DCGM path. DCGM has no public snapshot-of-running-PIDs
    API: `DCGM_FI_DEV_COMPUTE_PIDS` is a time-series field where each
    value decodes to one `c_dcgmRunningProcess_t` (per
    `dcgm_field_helpers.py:67-71`), and there is no
    `dcgmGetDeviceProcesses` exported in `libdcgm.so`. This is a
    property of the upstream API shapes, not a design preference —
    DCGM is built for time-series GPU monitoring, NVML for snapshot
    device queries. See design doc §6.3 note 2 / §11 Q3.

    Stale-handle recovery
    ---------------------
    When the operator restarts `nvidia-dcgm` (pod eviction, upgrade,
    chart rollback), the cached `DcgmHandle` and per-GPU `DcgmGroup`
    objects become invalid; the next API call raises
    `dcgmExceptionClass(DCGM_ST_CONNECTION_NOT_VALID)` per the
    upstream test (`DCGM/testing/python3/tests/test_connection.py:48-87`).
    Every hostengine-touching method routes through `_with_reconnect`,
    which catches that specific error code exactly once, flushes the
    group cache, rebuilds the handle, and retries. Persistent failure
    propagates so the agent's reconcile loop logs it and the next
    reconcile tick tries again. See §6.3.1.

    `restore_default` reads field 163
    --------------------------------
    DCGM exposes four distinct power-limit fields
    (`dcgm_fields.py:232-238`): MIN, MAX, DEF, current. NVML's
    `nvmlDeviceGetPowerManagementDefaultLimit` returns the
    factory default (`DEF`), which on every shipped data-center SKU
    equals MAX but is conceptually distinct. We read DEF to match
    NVML's restore semantics byte-for-byte on hypothetical future
    SKUs where default < max. See §11 Q5.
