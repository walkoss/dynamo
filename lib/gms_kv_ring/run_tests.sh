# Run the gms_kv_ring suite. Uses pytest-xdist with 4 subprocess
# workers — each worker is a fresh Python process, so CUDA driver
# state accumulated over many engine attach/detach cycles never
# crosses test boundaries. This gives deterministic 28/28.
#
# Why xdist and not pytest-forked: pytest-forked uses os.fork(), which
# CUDA doesn't survive (cuInit returns CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED in
# the child). xdist spawns subprocess workers via execnet, so each
# worker initializes CUDA fresh.
#
# Why -n 4 and not -n auto: with full parallelism, the Rust speedup
# microbench can fail on a heavily-loaded CPU since Python and Rust
# both slow down but at different rates. -n 4 keeps the worker count
# below typical CPU count.
#
# Pass-through args: anything you pass is forwarded to pytest.
