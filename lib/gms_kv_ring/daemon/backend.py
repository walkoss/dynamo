"""Storage-backend abstraction.

The daemon's storage tier is a pluggable thing: today's `StorageTier`
writes local files; tomorrow's `NixlBackend` ships bytes over a
NIXL transport (POSIX plugin for disk, OBJ plugin for S3) and a
`MooncakeBackend` uses the Mooncake transfer engine.

All backends implement the same `StorageBackend` interface so the
daemon shell, the engine RPCs, and the sweeper can treat them
uniformly. The slot dataclass `StorageSlot` is the abstract record;
backends are free to subclass it to attach backend-specific resource
handles (e.g., a file path for the local backend, an object key for
NIXL OBJ).

Crash semantics: a backend method may raise. The daemon wraps backend
calls in a `BackendSupervisor` (see `daemon/supervisor.py`) that
catches Python exceptions, increments a metric, and re-creates the
backend instance after N consecutive failures. A C-level SIGSEGV
from a transport library will still kill the whole daemon — surviving
that requires subprocess workers, which is a separate evolution."""

        from durable state (disk files / remote registry / etc).

        normal operation.
      - Cleanup primitives (`prune_older_than`, `enforce_byte_quota`,
        `enforce_per_engine_byte_quota`) are driven by the sweeper
        thread and operator-driven RPCs.

    Slot identity is (engine_id, layer, offset). The backend owns the
