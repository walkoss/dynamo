# Power Agent — Helm Chart Packaging Plan

**Status:** Implemented — chart shipped at `deploy/helm/charts/power-agent/`
(`Chart.yaml` `version: 1.0.0`, `appVersion: "1.0.0"`). Landed in
[PR #9682](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/9682) (PR 1a of the
PR-9369 split). The container image is built from
`components/power_agent/Dockerfile` by the `power-agent` CI job. This
document remains the chart-shape source of truth.
**Author:** Kai Ma
**Date:** 2026-05-19 (initial); refreshed 2026-06-03 (status + build wiring)
**Goal:** Replace the raw `deploy/power_agent/{daemonset,rbac,dev-pod}.yaml`
manifests (shipped in [PR #9682](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/9682),
PR 1a of the PR-9369 split) with a Helm chart at
`deploy/helm/charts/power-agent/`, modelled on the existing
`deploy/helm/charts/snapshot/` precedent. The chart structurally fixes three
Major CodeRabbit comments on PR9682 about parameterization and reproducibility.

### Revision history

| Rev | Date | Changes |
|-----|------|---------|
| v1 | 2026-05-19 | Initial plan. All five §6 decisions from the 2026-05-19 design session locked in: (§6.1) smaller scope — Power Agent only, planner-dev artifacts in PR9683/9687 untouched; (§6.2) Option α — fold chart into PR9682 directly; (§6.3) Option A — `dev-pod.yaml` ships as a gated template inside the same chart; (§6.4) delete the raw `deploy/power_agent/{daemonset,rbac,dev-pod}.yaml` in the same PR as the chart lands; (§6.5) this document. |
| v1.1 | 2026-05-19 | Added §1.4 — End-to-end user flow. Pre-empts the "does this actually deliver a `helm something → ready to run` experience" question by making the post-plan three-command flow (2 × `helm install` + 1 × `kubectl apply` for the workload DGD) explicit, and by mapping every infrastructure primitive a power-aware planner needs to the chart that installs it. No decision change; doc-only refinement. |
| v1.2 | 2026-05-19 | Incorporated review-cycle feedback (evidence-based accept/reject pass): (1) **§4.2** — removed dead `agent.reconcileIntervalSeconds` knob (verified `power_agent.py:529-552` exposes only 4 CLI flags; `RECONCILE_INTERVAL_S = 15` is a hardcoded module constant with no flag); added a maintenance-window rationale comment to `daemonset.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable: 1` explaining why the conservative safety default is kept and when to override for large fleets. (2) **§4.4** — added a third template helper `power-agent.effectiveNamespaceRestricted` that forces namespace-scoped RBAC when `dev.enabled=true` (justified by `power_agent.py:541-546` already accepting `--namespace`; dev mode pins to one node + one namespace, so cluster-wide RBAC is gratuitous). (3) **§5.3** — strengthened chart-README requirements: dev-mode `kubectl create configmap` recipe is now ordered as a *prerequisite* step (before `helm install`), not just a post-install NOTES.txt hint; added a one-line note that the chart uses the canonical NVIDIA monitoring-agent pattern (privileged + `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all`, no `nvidia.com/gpu` claim — privileged container bypasses the unprivileged-visibility edge case). (4) **§6** risk register — updated row 7 (ConfigMap prerequisite escalation); added row 9 covering the dead-knob audit principle (every `values.yaml` key must have a verified template-side or CLI-side wiring). Three of four reviewer points fully accepted; one (Consideration 1 default change) partial-accepted as "preserve `maxUnavailable: 1` default, document the override for large fleets" because power-cap enforcement is safety-critical and the parameterization the reviewer asked for is already in the proposed values surface. |
| v1.3 | 2026-06-03 | Status-line + build refresh (PR #9682 review by @sttts): (1) flipped the header **Status** from "Draft v1 — no code authored yet" to "Implemented" now that the chart, templates, and `power_agent.py` are all in the tree on this PR — the stale draft marker no longer matched reality. (2) Added a container build: `components/power_agent/Dockerfile` (single-stage `python:3.11-slim-bookworm`, NVML injected at runtime by `runtimeClassName: nvidia`, deps `pynvml` / `kubernetes` / `prometheus-client`) plus a dedicated `power-agent` CI job in `pr.yaml` + `post-merge-ci.yml`, gated on a new `power_agent` changed-files filter — answers the reviewer's "where is it built?" on `values.yaml` `image.repository`. |

## 1. Context

### 1.1 Where the in-flight PR tree sits

The 6 stacked PRs from `pr9369-split-plan.md` are all open as of
2026-05-19. PR9682 (PR 1a — Power Agent) and PR9683 (PR 1b — Planner
Infrastructure) are out of Draft; the rest are still Draft per the
cascade protocol in §4.5 of the split plan:

| PR | Branch | Base | State | Deploy YAML it introduces |
|----|--------|------|-------|---------------------------|
| **#9682** | `pr1a/power-agent` | `main` (upstream tip `f20ff4e28a`) | Ready | `deploy/power_agent/{daemonset,rbac,dev-pod}.yaml` (293 LOC) |
| **#9683** | `pr1b/planner-infra` | `pr1a/power-agent` | Ready | `deploy/planner-pod-rbac-dev.yaml` (DEPRECATED transitional file); operator chart bump 1.2.0→1.2.1 with planner pod RBAC in `deploy/helm/charts/platform/components/operator/templates/planner.yaml` |
| #9684 | `pr2/power-budget` | `pr1b/...` | Draft | none |
| #9685 | `pr3/aic-optimizer` | `pr2/...` | Draft | none |
| #9686 | `pr4/testbed` | `pr3/...` | Draft | none |
| #9687 | `pr5/docs-devenv` | `pr4/testbed` | Draft | `deploy/planner/dev/{planner-dev-pod,qwen3-quickstart-dgd,llama-quickstart-dgd}.yaml`; `examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-{power-aware,conservative-cold-start}.yaml` |

This plan only touches **PR9682**. PR9683/9684/9685/9686/9687 are
explicitly unchanged (see §3.1 for the scope decision and §6.1 for the
PR-isolation rationale).

### 1.2 Reviewer signal that motivated this work

CodeRabbit filed three Major comments on PR9682's deploy YAMLs that all
reduce to "raw manifests can't carry the parameterization this chart
needs":

| File | Line | Severity | Quote |
|------|------|----------|-------|
| `deploy/power_agent/daemonset.yaml` | 35 | 🟠 Major | "The DaemonSet metadata.namespace is hardcoded to `default`, which causes mismatches with the RBAC/service account namespace." |
| `deploy/power_agent/daemonset.yaml` | 58 | 🟠 Major | "Use an immutable image reference instead of `:latest`. Mutable tags make rollouts non-reproducible." |
| `deploy/power_agent/rbac.yaml` | 50 | 🟠 Major | "`${POWER_AGENT_NAMESPACE}` is not a valid Kubernetes value … **Fix: set a concrete namespace … or template this manifest through Helm/Kustomize/envsubst before shipping it.**" |

All three collapse to a single root cause that Helm templating fixes
structurally; the reviewer's third comment names Helm directly as the
intended remedy.

### 1.3 Architectural precedent in-repo

`deploy/helm/charts/snapshot/` (Chart `snapshot` v1.2.0) is structurally
near-identical to the chart we need:

| Property | snapshot chart | proposed power-agent chart |
|----------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Standalone (not a subchart of platform) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Privileged DaemonSet on GPU nodes | ✅ (`privileged: true`, `hostPID: true`) | ✅ (`privileged: true`, `hostPID: true`) |
| `runtimeClassName: nvidia` for `libnvidia-ml.so` injection | ✅ | ✅ |
| Namespace-vs-cluster RBAC toggle | `rbac.namespaceRestricted` | `rbac.namespaceRestricted` |
| ServiceAccount + Role/ClusterRole + binding | ✅ | ✅ |
| ConfigMap with daemon settings | ✅ (config.yaml) | optional — see §4.2 |
| OpenShift SCC annotations | `openshift.enabled` | follow-up (§7.5) |

This plan inherits the snapshot chart's template patterns
verbatim where the structure permits.

### 1.4 End-to-end user flow

This section answers the "does this plan actually deliver `helm
something → ready to run` for a power-aware planner?" question. The
answer is **yes**, with the unavoidable caveat that the workload
itself (a DGD CR) is `kubectl apply`-ed, not `helm install`-ed —
matching the convention of every other DGD example in the repo.

#### 1.4.1 What a power-aware planner needs

The Planner is **not** a standalone Kubernetes deployment. It is a
`Planner:` service block inside a `DynamoGraphDeployment` CR (see
`examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-power-aware.yaml`
lines 59–92). The Dynamo Operator (running inside the platform Helm
chart) watches DGDs and spawns the planner Pod from that service
block. There is therefore no "planner deployment YAML" anywhere in
the repo — a fact that constrains the chart-design surface to the
Power Agent only.

The complete infrastructure inventory:

| Component | Kind | Source today | Helm-installable after this plan? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Dynamo Operator (creates planner pods from DGD specs) | Deployment | `deploy/helm/charts/platform/components/operator/` | ✅ already in **platform chart** |
| Planner pod RBAC (`Role`/`RoleBinding`/`ServiceAccount` with `pods: get/list/watch/patch`) | RBAC | `deploy/helm/charts/platform/components/operator/templates/planner.yaml` (chart 1.2.1+ from PR9683) | ✅ already in **platform chart** |
| Supporting platform deps (nats, etcd, grove, kai-scheduler, prometheus stack) | Various | platform chart's `dependencies:` block | ✅ already in **platform chart** |
| **Power Agent DaemonSet + RBAC** | DaemonSet + ClusterRole/Role + binding + SA | `deploy/power_agent/{daemonset,rbac}.yaml` (raw, PR9682) | ❌ today → ✅ via **new power-agent chart** from this plan |
| Power-aware DGD spec (the workload itself, including the `Planner:` block with `enable_power_awareness: true`) | DGD CR + optional `ConfigMap` for profiling data | `examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-power-aware.yaml` (user-customised) | ⚠️ remains `kubectl apply` — see §1.4.3 for why |

#### 1.4.2 Three-command flow after the plan ships

```bash
# 1. Install the Dynamo platform (existing chart; provides operator + planner RBAC + nats/etcd).
helm install dynamo-platform ./deploy/helm/charts/platform \
  --namespace dynamo-system --create-namespace

# 2. Install the Power Agent (NEW chart from this plan).
helm install power-agent ./deploy/helm/charts/power-agent \
  --namespace dynamo-system \
  --set image.tag=v1.0.0 \
  --set agent.safeDefaultWatts=500   # per-SKU; H200=500, H100=490, A100=280

# 3. Deploy the power-aware DGD workload (a copy of disagg-power-aware.yaml
#    with your own model, total_gpu_power_limit, and image tags).
kubectl apply -f my-power-aware-dgd.yaml -n my-workload-ns
```

Steps 1+2 are the "deployment" the reviewer feedback addresses: every
Kubernetes primitive the planner needs to exist before a power-aware
DGD can be reconciled is created by these two `helm install` commands.
Step 3 is the user's *workload*, which is true of every Dynamo
deployment regardless of power-awareness.

In environments where the platform is already installed cluster-wide
(per `dpp-dev-env.md`'s "Platform Status" section), the user-facing
experience collapses further to **a single `helm install
power-agent ...` command** plus the workload DGD apply.

#### 1.4.3 Why the workload DGD stays `kubectl apply`-ed

By repo convention, **no DGD example is Helm-templated**. As of
2026-05-19 there are 11 DGD examples in the tree
(`examples/global_planner/global-planner-*.yaml`,
`examples/backends/{vllm,sglang,trtllm}/deploy/disagg_planner.yaml`,
`examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-*.yaml`,
`components/src/dynamo/planner/tests/manual/scaling/*.yaml`); all of
them ship as raw `kubectl apply`-ready YAML that users copy and edit
in place. DGDs are workload specifications — they encode the user's
model choice, per-engine GPU counts, image tags, and (for power-aware
deployments) the `total_gpu_power_limit` rack-budget number that
depends on the user's specific cluster topology. Parametrising those
inside a Helm chart would invent a new convention divergent from
every other example, for no clear payoff.

The example file `examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-power-aware.yaml`
serves the same role for power-aware planners that
`examples/backends/vllm/deploy/disagg_planner.yaml` serves for
power-unaware ones: a starting template users copy and modify.

#### 1.4.4 What this plan does NOT deliver (and the planned follow-ups)

To pre-empt scope questions:

| Not in this plan | Where it lives today | When it gets addressed |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| `deploy/planner/dev/planner-dev-pod.yaml` (developer iteration console) | PR9687, raw envsubst-style YAML | Future PR after PR9687 merges — see §7.2 |
| `deploy/planner/dev/{qwen3,llama}-quickstart-dgd.yaml` (dev quickstart DGDs) | PR9687, raw YAML | Stays raw — DGD-by-convention; see §1.4.3 |
| `examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-*.yaml` (example power-aware DGDs) | PR9687, raw YAML | Stays raw — DGD-by-convention; see §1.4.3 |
| `deploy/planner-pod-rbac-dev.yaml` (DEPRECATED operator-chart ≤1.2.0 workaround) | PR9683, marked DEPRECATED in-file | Auto-retires when target clusters upgrade past chart 1.2.0; no chart needed |
| `dpp-dev-env.md` §3's manual `kubectl create sa planner-dev-sa` + `kubectl create rolebinding` recipe (for the dev console) | PR9687 documentation | Captured by §7.2 follow-up (would collapse to `helm install planner-dev …`) |
| OpenShift SCC annotations for the Power Agent DaemonSet | not yet implemented | §7.5 follow-up |

## 2. Inventory: every deployment YAML across the 6 PRs

(Reproduced from the 2026-05-19 design session, §2, for self-containment
of this doc.)

| File | PR | Kind | Class | In chart? |
|------|----|------|-------|-----------|
| `deploy/power_agent/daemonset.yaml` | 9682 | DaemonSet | Production | **YES** → `templates/daemonset.yaml` |
| `deploy/power_agent/rbac.yaml` | 9682 | SA + ClusterRole + ClusterRoleBinding | Production | **YES** → `templates/{serviceaccount,role,rolebinding}.yaml` |
| `deploy/power_agent/dev-pod.yaml` | 9682 | Pod (mounts `power_agent.py` via ConfigMap; for iterating on the agent itself) | Dev | **YES** → `templates/dev-pod.yaml`, gated `dev.enabled=false` |
| `deploy/planner-pod-rbac-dev.yaml` | 9683 | Role + RoleBinding | Dev workaround (DEPRECATED in its own header — operator chart 1.2.1+ supersedes it) | NO — file header already self-documents its retirement |
| `deploy/helm/charts/platform/components/operator/templates/planner.yaml` | 9683 | Templated planner RBAC inside the existing operator subchart | Production | Already in a chart; no change |
| `deploy/planner/dev/planner-dev-pod.yaml` | 9687 | Pod (long-lived `sleep infinity`; for iterating on planner Python source) | Dev | NO — different lifecycle (per-developer console, not a deployable). Out of scope per §6.1 decision. |
| `deploy/planner/dev/qwen3-quickstart-dgd.yaml` | 9687 | DGD CR | Dev/example | NO — DGD CRs are user-authored, not Helm-templated |
| `deploy/planner/dev/llama-quickstart-dgd.yaml` | 9687 | DGD CR | Dev/example | NO — same |
| `examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-power-aware.yaml` | 9687 | ConfigMap + DGD CR | Example | NO — examples remain in `examples/`, not Helm-packaged |
| `examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-conservative-cold-start.yaml` | 9687 | DGD CR | Example | NO — same |

**Net set in scope:** the three files in PR9682 only.

## 3. Decisions

### 3.1 Scope = Power Agent only (§6.1)

**Decision: smaller scope.** The chart covers `deploy/power_agent/*.yaml`
exclusively. `deploy/planner/dev/*.yaml`, `deploy/planner-pod-rbac-dev.yaml`,
and `examples/deployments/powerplanner/*.yaml` stay as raw YAML in their
respective PRs (9683 and 9687).

#### Rationale

1. **PR boundary integrity.** The §4.5 cascade protocol in
   `pr9369-split-plan.md` explicitly minimises mid-flight cross-PR
   churn. Helm-ifying PR9687's planner-dev YAML in this PR would force
   synchronised edits to PR9683 (delete `planner-pod-rbac-dev.yaml`)
   and PR9687 (delete `deploy/planner/dev/*.yaml` + adjust
   `dpp-dev-env.md`), violating the single-cascade rebase rule.

2. **Architectural cleanliness.** The Power Agent is a production
   runtime DaemonSet; `planner-dev-pod.yaml` is a personal developer
   console. Packaging them together would imply a relationship that
   does not exist in code. Confirmed: `power_agent.py` imports nothing
   from `dynamo.planner`; the planner-dev pod runs no power-agent
   functionality.

3. **Right-time fixes.** The envsubst-placeholder issues in
   `planner-dev-pod.yaml` (`${NS}`, `${DGD}`, `${DYN_NS}`) are real
   and will likely surface the same reviewer feedback we are
   addressing here — but their natural home is a follow-up PR after
   PR9687 merges, not a power-agent feature PR. See §7.2.

#### What we explicitly defer

A separate follow-up `chore(planner-dev): package developer environment
into Helm chart` is recommended after PR9687 merges. It would
package `deploy/planner/dev/` into a second chart at
`deploy/helm/charts/planner-dev/`. Not in scope for this plan; flagged
in §7.2.

### 3.2 PR integration = Option α (§6.2)

**Decision: fold the chart into PR9682 directly** by adding a new commit
on top of the existing `pr1a/power-agent` branch. Force-push is **not**
required (additive commit only).

#### Rationale

1. **Same-PR causality.** CodeRabbit filed the templating ask on PR9682;
   the templating fix lands on PR9682. Diagnosis and remedy are tied
   together in one review cycle.

2. **Cascade-protocol compliance.** Option β (insert a new PR 1c between
   1a and 1b) would force rebases of `pr1b`, `pr2`, `pr3`, `pr4`, and
   `pr5` — exactly the multi-PR churn the §4.5 cascade protocol exists
   to prevent. Option γ (defer to a follow-up after PR9682 merges) leaves
   a window of known-bad raw YAML in `main` between PR9682 merging and
   the follow-up landing, and forces a separate review for the raw-YAML
   deletion.

3. **Manageable size growth.** PR9682 grows from 1,534 → ~1,830 LOC
   (+~300 net: +~450 chart additions, -~150 raw-YAML deletions). Review
   character stays "Low — net-new component, own tests" because the
   chart is structurally a transliteration of three raw files into the
   templated equivalents plus a values-surface declaration; there are
   no algorithmic changes.

#### What changes on PR9682

The branch gains **one new commit** on top of the existing
`ec210811ee feat(power-agent): per-node power-cap enforcement DaemonSet`:

```
feat(power-agent): Helm chart for the DaemonSet + RBAC

Adds deploy/helm/charts/power-agent/, modelled on the existing
snapshot chart. Parameterises namespace, image, safe-default-watts,
RBAC scope (cluster vs namespace), nodeSelector/tolerations/resources.
Supersedes the raw deploy/power_agent/{daemonset,rbac,dev-pod}.yaml
manifests, which this commit removes.

Addresses CodeRabbit review comments on PR #9682:
  - daemonset.yaml:35 (hardcoded namespace: default)
  - daemonset.yaml:58 (mutable :latest image tag)
  - rbac.yaml:50 (${POWER_AGENT_NAMESPACE} envsubst placeholder)
```

### 3.3 Dev-pod placement = Option A (§6.3)

**Decision: `templates/dev-pod.yaml` ships inside the chart**, gated by
`.Values.dev.enabled` (default `false`). When `dev.enabled=true`, the
template renders the Pod and skips the DaemonSet; when `false`, only
the DaemonSet renders. The two are mutually exclusive — a `helm` template-
time `{{- fail }}` enforces that the caller does not enable both
simultaneously.

#### Rationale

1. **Single chart, one install path.** A developer iterating on
   `power_agent.py` runs the same `helm install` command with a
   `--values dev-values.yaml` overlay rather than learning a second
   manifest-apply workflow.

2. **Parameterisation parity.** The dev pod inherits namespace, image,
   safe-default-watts, and resource overrides from the same values
   surface as the production DaemonSet. No duplication.

3. **Mutual exclusion is template-time, not run-time.** The chart fails
   to render if both `daemonset.enabled` and `dev.enabled` are true,
   so misconfiguration surfaces as a clear `helm template` error
   rather than two competing Pods at runtime.

### 3.4 Raw-YAML disposition = Delete in same PR (§6.4)

**Decision: delete `deploy/power_agent/{daemonset,rbac,dev-pod}.yaml`
in the same commit that adds the chart.**

#### Rationale

1. **Single source of truth.** Keeping the raw YAML alongside the chart
   creates two install paths and an unspecified preference. Reviewers
   would reasonably ask "which is canonical?"

2. **GitOps-repo blast radius is small.** The Power Agent has not yet
   shipped on `main` (PR9682 is still open). No production user has
   a GitOps reference to `deploy/power_agent/daemonset.yaml` yet. The
   "breaking change" risk that motivated the "keep one minor version
   with DEPRECATED headers" alternative does not apply at this stage.

3. **Documentation alignment.** `components/power_agent/README.md` and
   `examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-power-aware.yaml` both
   reference `kubectl apply -f deploy/power_agent/...`. Those
   references update in the same commit to the `helm install ...`
   invocation. (See §5.3 for the doc-touch surface.)

#### What we do NOT delete

- `components/power_agent/` (the Python source and unit tests) is the
  agent's home, untouched by this plan.
- `components/power_agent/README.md` updates its deployment recipe
  section to reference the chart but is not deleted.

### 3.5 Document persistence (§6.5)

**Decision: this file (`docs/design-docs/power-agent-helm-chart-plan.md`)
ships as a tracked design-doc** in PR9682 alongside the chart. Style
follows the existing `docs/design-docs/pr9369-split-plan.md`
convention (sibling design-doc style adopted across the
`docs/design-docs/power-agent-*.md` series).

#### Rationale

Mirrors how the PR-9369 split itself was documented. A reviewer
looking at PR9682 sees both *what* changed (the chart) and *why* the
chart shape is what it is (this doc) in the same diff. Future
discussions about whether to add a planner-dev chart can be grounded
against the decisions recorded here.

8 files total. ~450 LOC (estimate based on snapshot chart's analogous
templates, minus the bits that don't apply: no PVC, no seccomp, no
config ConfigMap in the v1 chart — see §4.2).

**Why no ConfigMap for chart-rendered config in v1.** The agent's CLI
surface (verified against `power_agent.py:529-552`) is exactly 4 flags:
`--safe-default-watts`, `--node-name`, `--namespace`, `--prometheus-port`.
All four pass cleanly as command-line flags or container env; adding a
ConfigMap layer is premature. If the settings surface grows later (e.g.,
a per-SKU caps table, or a future `--reconcile-interval` flag), we can
introduce the ConfigMap then. Same pattern as the snapshot chart, which
only introduced its ConfigMap when CRIU's option surface justified it.

### 4.3 Structural fixes the chart delivers

Mapping each CodeRabbit-flagged issue to the chart construct that resolves it:

| CodeRabbit comment (raw YAML) | Chart construct | Resolution |
|------------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| `daemonset.yaml:35` namespace hardcoded to `default` | `metadata: { namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }} }` in `templates/daemonset.yaml` and `templates/dev-pod.yaml` | Namespace flows from `--namespace` flag at install time; no chart edit needed to deploy in a different namespace |
| `daemonset.yaml:58` `:latest` mutable image tag | `tag: ""` in `values.yaml` (no default) + `{{- if not .Values.image.tag }}{{- fail "image.tag is required (pin to a release tag or digest)" }}{{- end }}` in `_helpers.tpl` | Chart refuses to install without an explicit tag; caller pins via `--set image.tag=v1.0.0` or `--set image.tag=sha256:abc...` |
| `rbac.yaml:50` `${POWER_AGENT_NAMESPACE}` envsubst placeholder | `namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}` in `templates/rolebinding.yaml` | No envsubst step; Helm resolves natively |

The chart also resolves an issue CodeRabbit *didn't* file but is worth
addressing: today's raw `rbac.yaml` ships `ClusterRole`+`ClusterRoleBinding`
unconditionally — fine in single-tenant clusters but excessive in
multi-tenant ones. The `rbac.namespaceRestricted` toggle (mirroring
snapshot's pattern) gives both options.

### 4.4 Template-time invariants

Three `_helpers.tpl` constructs that prevent foot-guns at install time
rather than runtime:

```gotemplate
{{- define "power-agent.validateImageTag" -}}
{{- if not .Values.image.tag -}}
{{- fail "image.tag is required (pin to a release tag or sha256:digest; :latest is not supported)" -}}
{{- end -}}
{{- end -}}

{{- define "power-agent.validateMutex" -}}
{{- if and .Values.daemonset.enabled .Values.dev.enabled -}}
{{- fail "daemonset.enabled and dev.enabled are mutually exclusive. Set exactly one." -}}
{{- end -}}
{{- if and .Values.dev.enabled (not .Values.dev.nodeName) -}}
{{- fail "dev.enabled requires dev.nodeName (the GPU node to pin the dev pod to)." -}}
{{- end -}}
{{- end -}}

{{- /*
  Effective RBAC scope. Dev mode pins to one node and one namespace, so
  cluster-wide pod-listing RBAC would be excessive. The agent's
  --namespace CLI flag (power_agent.py:541-546) already constrains its
  pod queries to a single namespace when set, so namespace-scoped RBAC
  is sufficient. The dev-pod template passes --namespace=$(POD_NAMESPACE)
  via the downward API; this helper makes the RBAC default match.

  An operator can still opt back into cluster-wide RBAC in dev mode by
  explicitly setting --set rbac.namespaceRestricted=false AND
  --set dev.namespaceRestrictedOverride=true. Without that second flag,
  the dev-mode default wins.
*/ -}}
{{- define "power-agent.effectiveNamespaceRestricted" -}}
{{- if and .Values.dev.enabled (not .Values.dev.namespaceRestrictedOverride) -}}
true
{{- else -}}
{{- .Values.rbac.namespaceRestricted | toString -}}
{{- end -}}
{{- end -}}
```

`validateImageTag` and `validateMutex` are called once each from
`templates/daemonset.yaml` and `templates/dev-pod.yaml` respectively, so
the failures surface at `helm install` / `helm template` time.
`effectiveNamespaceRestricted` is referenced from `templates/role.yaml`
and `templates/rolebinding.yaml` in place of
`.Values.rbac.namespaceRestricted` so the dev-mode default takes effect
for both the Role/ClusterRole kind selection and the Binding kind.

To support this helper, the values surface gains one additional opt-out
key:

```yaml
dev:
  ...
  # Set to true ONLY if you genuinely need cluster-wide pod-listing RBAC
  # while iterating on power_agent.py (e.g., testing cross-namespace
  # multi-pod conflict resolution). Default: false — dev mode forces
  # namespace-scoped RBAC for principle of least privilege.
  namespaceRestrictedOverride: false
```

## 5. PR mechanics

### 5.1 Commit plan on `pr1a/power-agent`

One additional commit on top of the existing branch tip
`ec210811ee feat(power-agent): per-node power-cap enforcement DaemonSet`:

```
feat(power-agent): Helm chart for the DaemonSet + RBAC

Adds deploy/helm/charts/power-agent/, a standalone chart modelled on
deploy/helm/charts/snapshot/. Parameterises:
  - namespace (Release.Namespace, no more hardcoded default)
  - image (no default tag; required at install time)
  - safe-default-watts, reconcile interval, Prometheus port
  - nodeSelector, tolerations, resources
  - RBAC scope (cluster-wide vs Release.Namespace)
  - production DS mode vs in-cluster dev-pod mode (mutually exclusive)

Supersedes the raw deploy/power_agent/{daemonset,rbac,dev-pod}.yaml
manifests, which this commit removes.

Updates components/power_agent/README.md and the planner power-aware
example to reference `helm install` instead of `kubectl apply -f`.

Addresses CodeRabbit review comments on PR #9682:
  - daemonset.yaml:35 (hardcoded namespace: default)
  - daemonset.yaml:58 (mutable :latest image tag)
  - rbac.yaml:50  (${POWER_AGENT_NAMESPACE} envsubst placeholder)

Design rationale: docs/design-docs/power-agent-helm-chart-plan.md
```

No `--force-push`. No history rewrite. The original
`ec210811ee` stays as-is; reviewers who already started reviewing it
see only the new chart commit on top.

### 5.2 Files added / removed / modified

**Added (~450 LOC, 9 files):**

```

**Modified (~30 LOC of doc touch-up):**

```
components/power_agent/README.md       (replace kubectl-apply recipe with helm-install)

```

(Last item: the planner-group filter already covers `deploy/power_agent/**`
per PR9682. Adding the chart path keeps chart-only changes triggering
the same CI job set.)

**Net delta on PR9682:** +480, -290 → ~+190 net. PR9682 total grows
from 1,534 → ~1,720 insertions.

### 5.3 Doc-touch ripple

The deletion of raw `deploy/power_agent/*.yaml` invalidates a handful
of references elsewhere in PR9682's tree. All updates land in the same
commit:

| File | Current text | Updated text |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `components/power_agent/README.md` §Deployment | `kubectl apply -f deploy/power_agent/rbac.yaml` then `daemonset.yaml` | `helm install power-agent ./deploy/helm/charts/power-agent --namespace <ns> --set image.tag=<release>` |
| `examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-power-aware.yaml` header | "Deploy the Power Agent DaemonSet: `kubectl apply -f deploy/power_agent/rbac.yaml` …" | "Deploy the Power Agent: `helm install power-agent ./deploy/helm/charts/power-agent …`" |
| `examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-conservative-cold-start.yaml` header | (same as above) | (same as above) |
| `.github/filters.yaml` planner-group | covers `deploy/power_agent/**` | also covers `deploy/helm/charts/power-agent/**` |

Note: `examples/deployments/powerplanner/*.yaml` and the planner-pod-rbac-dev
file live in **other** PRs (9687 and 9683 respectively) — those references
will be reconciled when those PRs rebase onto PR9682's updated tip in the
normal cascade flow.

#### 5.3.1 Chart README content requirements (incorporating v1.2 review feedback)

The chart's own `deploy/helm/charts/power-agent/README.md` must include
the following sections explicitly. These are not optional polish — each
addresses a specific point in the v1.2 review-feedback cycle:

1. **Prerequisites** — note that the chart uses the canonical NVIDIA
   monitoring-agent pattern (privileged container + `runtimeClassName: nvidia`
   + `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all`), so the DaemonSet does **not** consume
   an `nvidia.com/gpu` resource claim. Same pattern as DCGM Exporter and
   the snapshot chart. The privileged container also bypasses the
   `accept-nvidia-visible-devices-envvar-when-unprivileged=false` runtime
   config edge case (addresses Consideration 3).

2. **Production install** — minimal `helm install` recipe with explicit
   `--set image.tag=<pinned>` (addresses CodeRabbit comment on `:latest`).

3. **Dev install** — split into two ordered steps:

   > **Step 1 (REQUIRED before `helm install`):** Create the script ConfigMap.
   >
   > ```bash
   > kubectl create configmap dynamo-power-agent-script \
   >   --from-file=power_agent.py=components/power_agent/power_agent.py \
   >   -n $NAMESPACE
   > ```
   >
   > Without this ConfigMap the dev pod will stay `Pending` with a
   > `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "script"` event. The chart does
   > not create the ConfigMap automatically because the developer
   > iteration loop is `kubectl create cm --from-file=... --dry-run=client
   > -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -` (faster than `helm upgrade --set-file`).
   >
   > **Step 2:** Install the chart in dev mode (pinned to one GPU node):
   >
   > ```bash
   > helm install power-agent ./deploy/helm/charts/power-agent \
   >   --namespace $NAMESPACE \
   >   --set image.tag=v1.0.0 \
   >   --set daemonset.enabled=false \
   >   --set dev.enabled=true \
   >   --set dev.nodeName=<gpu-node-name>
   > ```
   >
   > Dev mode automatically forces namespace-scoped RBAC (Role +
   > RoleBinding instead of ClusterRole + ClusterRoleBinding) because
   > the pod is pinned to one node and uses `--namespace=$POD_NAMESPACE`
   > (addresses Consideration 2). Override with
   > `--set dev.namespaceRestrictedOverride=true` only if you genuinely
   > need cluster-wide pod visibility while iterating.

4. **Values table** — generated/maintained list of all keys with
   defaults and short descriptions, mirroring `deploy/helm/charts/snapshot/README.md`'s
   "Important values" section.

5. **Rollout strategy on large fleets** — one-sentence callout pointing
   at the `daemonset.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable` value
   with the trade-off explained (addresses Consideration 1).

6. **Uninstall** — `helm uninstall power-agent -n $NAMESPACE`. The chart
   does **not** clean up `/var/lib/dynamo-power-agent/managed_gpus.json`
   on host nodes — call out that this hostPath state persists until
   manually cleaned (`rm -f /var/lib/dynamo-power-agent/managed_gpus.json`
   on each node) or until the next agent install reads it for cold-start
   orphan recovery.

NOTES.txt (post-install) repeats the dev-mode ConfigMap recipe even
though it's already in the README, so a developer who skipped the docs
gets the recipe at install time too.

### 5.4 Validation gates the commit must pass

Before the commit gets pushed to `pr1a/power-agent`:

1. **`helm lint deploy/helm/charts/power-agent`** — zero errors.
2. **`helm template`** with three representative value overlays:
   - default (production DS, cluster RBAC)
   - `--set rbac.namespaceRestricted=true`
   - `--set daemonset.enabled=false --set dev.enabled=true --set dev.nodeName=<gpu-node>`
   Each produces a valid set of manifests (`kubectl --dry-run=client apply -f -` passes).
3. **`helm template`** with no image tag set — must fail fast at template time with the message from §4.4's `validateImageTag` helper.
4. **`helm template`** with both `daemonset.enabled=true` and `dev.enabled=true` — must fail fast at template time with the `validateMutex` message.
5. **Pre-commit hooks pass on the chart files** — the same 8 hooks the v3.3 §7 checklist enforces (isort/black/flake8/codespell/end-of-file-fixer/trailing-whitespace/check-yaml/ruff). `check-yaml` is the relevant one for chart files; the rest don't touch YAML.
6. **No CI regression** — planner-group jobs trigger and pass (the chart sits inside the planner-group path filter; same job set that already covers `deploy/power_agent/**`).

`helm-unittest` (used by the `deploy/helm/charts/platform/Makefile`) is
optional for v1. Adding a `tests/` directory with a few representative
templated-output assertions is a candidate for a v1.1 follow-up; not
blocking the first release of the chart.

---

## 6. Risk register

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Chart name collision with another `power-agent` release in some user's cluster | Low (chart is new, no upstream precedent) | Chart name `power-agent` is unique among `deploy/helm/charts/` and `helm search hub` results; no action needed |
| 2 | OpenShift / SCC compatibility — power-agent needs the same `openshift.io/required-scc: privileged` treatment as snapshot agent | Medium | Out of scope for v1 (snapshot took it as a v1.1+ addition too). Capture as follow-up issue; for v1 the chart works on vanilla K8s with no SCC. See §7.5. |
| 3 | Image-tag requirement breaks demo flows that previously used `:latest` | Low (no production users yet — PR9682 is open) | README documents the requirement prominently; demo recipe in `examples/deployments/powerplanner/` will reference a pinned tag |
| 4 | Reviewers ask "why is this in PR9682 and not a separate PR?" | Medium | Pre-empted by §3.2 rationale + §1.2 CodeRabbit linkage in the PR description |
| 5 | `helm-unittest` absence flagged in review (other charts use it) | Low (only the platform umbrella chart uses it today; snapshot does not) | Document the deferral in the chart README; add as v1.1 follow-up |
| 6 | Chart `appVersion` drift from `power_agent.py` over time | Medium (long-term) | v1: appVersion = "1.0.0" matches chart version = 1.0.0. Document in the chart README that subsequent agent revs bump both in lock-step. If the appVersion gets out of sync in a future PR, that's a release-process bug, not a chart-design bug. |
| 7 | `dev.scriptConfigMap` is named externally; users may forget to create it | Medium (only affects dev mode) | **v1.2 update:** the ConfigMap-creation recipe is promoted from a post-install NOTES.txt hint to a **prerequisite step ordered before `helm install`** in the chart README (see §5.3.1 step 3). NOTES.txt repeats the recipe post-install for safety. Chart `helm install` itself does not error if the CM is missing — failure mode is a Pending Pod with a clear `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "script"` event, which is debuggable. Auto-creation via Helm pre-install hook was considered and rejected (extra RBAC + Job machinery for a dev-only feature). |
| 8 | Cascade impact: PR9683 base auto-updates when PR9682's tip moves | Low (PR9683 is `pr1b/planner-infra` based on `pr1a/power-agent`; new commit on `pr1a` is a non-conflicting addition to a disjoint file tree) | Confirmed by inspection: PR9683's diff touches `deploy/helm/charts/platform/...`, `deploy/planner-pod-rbac-dev.yaml`, and planner Python files only. None of these collide with `deploy/helm/charts/power-agent/`. PR9683 rebases trivially. |
| 9 | Dead-knob risk: a `values.yaml` key whose name suggests it does something but is never wired to a template or CLI flag (silently no-ops; user thinks they configured it). | Medium (one such case found in v1.1: `agent.reconcileIntervalSeconds`, which had no `power_agent.py` CLI wiring — dropped in v1.2 per the v1.2 revision note) | Apply the **dead-knob audit principle** when authoring: every key in `values.yaml` must trace to either (a) a `{{ .Values.xxx }}` reference in a `templates/*.yaml`, or (b) a CLI flag in `power_agent.py:main()` whose `args.xxx` is consumed by `PowerAgent.__init__`. Audit during the §8 authoring checklist (new sub-bullet). If a desired knob has no current wiring, drop it from `values.yaml` and open a separate Python PR to add the flag first. |

---

## 7. Out of scope / follow-ups

### 7.1 `helm-unittest` tests for the power-agent chart

`deploy/helm/charts/platform/Makefile` defines a `test` target wired to
`helm-unittest`. Adding a `deploy/helm/charts/power-agent/tests/`
directory with templated-output assertions would round out the
chart's verification surface. Deferred to a v1.1 follow-up. (Snapshot
chart shipped without unittest tests too.)

### 7.2 Planner-dev Helm chart (`deploy/helm/charts/planner-dev/`)

Recommended as a separate follow-up PR after PR9687 merges. Scope:

- `deploy/planner/dev/planner-dev-pod.yaml` → templated Pod
- `deploy/planner-pod-rbac-dev.yaml` rules (currently in PR9683 as a transitional file) → templated Role + RoleBinding gated on `legacyOperatorCompat: false`
- Optional: `deploy/planner/dev/{qwen3,llama}-quickstart-dgd.yaml` → values-driven DGD ConfigMap

This would also collapse `dpp-dev-env.md` §1–§3's manual
`kubectl create sa` / `kubectl create rolebinding` recipe to one
`helm install planner-dev …` invocation. Out of scope for this plan
because:
- It requires PR9687 to be merged or close to it (the source files
  for the chart live in PR9687).
- It does not relate to the CodeRabbit feedback that motivated the
  power-agent chart, so coupling them in one PR would be a category
  error.

### 7.3 Example DGD packaging

`examples/deployments/powerplanner/disagg-*.yaml` are reference DGD
specifications, not Kubernetes primitives a Helm chart owns. Other
DGD examples in the repo (`examples/deployments/Kubernetes/*.yaml`)
remain raw YAML by convention. **No plan to Helm-ify these.** If
users want parametric DGD generation, that belongs in a separate
`dgd-templates/` design discussion.

### 7.4 Power-agent appVersion bumping policy

For v1 the chart `version` and `appVersion` both pin to `"1.0.0"` and
match the literal string in the (currently unwritten) version manifest
of `components/power_agent/`. When `power_agent.py` next gains a
substantive behaviour change, both bump together. Codifying this as a
chart-release policy (e.g., a pre-commit check that diffs
`power_agent.py` LOC against `Chart.yaml` `appVersion`) is **out of
scope for v1**; capture as a future operational hygiene task if it
becomes a real risk.

### 7.5 OpenShift SCC support

The snapshot chart's `openshift.enabled` toggle adds
`openshift.io/required-scc: privileged` pod annotations and an OCP
rbac-privileged template. The power-agent needs the same treatment
on OpenShift clusters. **Out of scope for v1** to keep the first
chart cycle focused; flagged as a v1.1 follow-up issue.

## 8. Pre-flight checklist

Mirror of `pr9369-split-plan.md` §7, scoped to this work:

**Pre-flight (one-time setup):**

- [ ] Confirm `helm` (v3.13+) is installed and `helm lint` is on PATH.
- [ ] Confirm `kubectl --dry-run=client` is available for the §5.4 step-2 validation.
- [ ] Confirm the `pr1a/power-agent` branch is in sync with origin and has no unpushed local work that would collide.
- [ ] Re-read the CodeRabbit comments on PR9682 to ensure no new templating-related feedback was filed since this plan was drafted.

**Authoring:**

- [ ] Author all 9 chart files following §4.1's layout.
- [ ] Cross-check every Helm value reference (`{{ .Values.xxx }}`) against the §4.2 values schema — no orphaned values, no missing defaults.
- [ ] **Dead-knob audit (v1.2, risk register #9):** confirm every key in the chart's `values.yaml` traces to either a `{{ .Values.xxx }}` reference in `templates/*.yaml` or a CLI flag in `power_agent.py:main()`. If any key has no wiring, drop it from `values.yaml` rather than ship dead configuration surface. (Specifically: the v1.1 draft had `agent.reconcileIntervalSeconds` as such a dead knob — verify it does not reappear.)
- [ ] **RBAC effective-scope audit (v1.2, helper):** confirm `templates/role.yaml` and `templates/rolebinding.yaml` reference `include "power-agent.effectiveNamespaceRestricted" .` rather than `.Values.rbac.namespaceRestricted` directly. Test `helm template --set dev.enabled=true --set dev.nodeName=foo` produces `Role` + `RoleBinding` (not `ClusterRole`).
- [ ] Run `helm lint` on the chart — zero errors.
- [ ] Run the three `helm template` exercises from §5.4 and confirm each renders to valid manifests.
- [ ] Run the two negative-path `helm template` exercises (missing image tag, mutex violation) and confirm both fail with the §4.4 helper messages.

**Doc touch-up:**

- [ ] Update `components/power_agent/README.md` §Deployment to the `helm install` recipe (§5.3).
- [ ] Update both `examples/deployments/powerplanner/*.yaml` headers (§5.3).
- [ ] Update `.github/filters.yaml` planner-group filter (§5.3).
- [ ] Confirm `docs/design-docs/power-agent-helm-chart-plan.md` (this file) is committed.

**Commit + push:**

- [ ] Stage everything as one logical commit with the §5.1 message.
- [ ] `git push origin pr1a/power-agent` — no `--force` flag.
- [ ] On the PR page, post a brief comment summarising what changed and pointing at the three CodeRabbit comments now resolved.
- [ ] Resolve the three CodeRabbit comments on PR9682 with a link to the new chart files (CodeRabbit usually auto-detects resolution from the diff, but a human confirmation closes them definitively).

**Post-push verification:**

- [ ] CI on `pr1a/power-agent` passes (planner-group jobs + any chart-lint jobs).
- [ ] `helm install` against a dev cluster succeeds end-to-end:
  ```bash
  helm install power-agent ./deploy/helm/charts/power-agent \
    --namespace <ns> \
    --set image.tag=<pinned-tag> \
    --set agent.safeDefaultWatts=500
  kubectl rollout status daemonset/power-agent-agent -n <ns>
  kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=power-agent -n <ns> --tail=50
  ```
- [ ] All 43 `components/power_agent/tests/` tests still pass (no code changes — sanity smoke only).
